# Ants vs. SomeBees

Ants vs. SomeBees is a tower-defense game. The ant queen populates its colony with her bravest ants. The ants must protect the queen from evil bees that invade the territory. If enough leaves are thrown at the bees, they will be vanquished. If the player fails to pester the airborne intruders adequately, the queen ant will succumb to the bees' wrath.

This project combines functional and object-oriented programming paradigms.
